                        TRANSACTIONS; DISPUTES</span></h2>
                <p class=" wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp"><strong>2.1 Smart-Contracts.</strong> The Service enables buyers (a <strong>“Buyer”</strong> ) and
                    sellers (<strong>“Sellers”</strong> ) of certain
                    commodities to enter into smart-contracts that enable a transaction protocol that automatically
                    executes, controls and/or documents the transaction events and actions, for example, purchase price,
                    quality control standards, and quantity, according to the terms of the contract specified and
                    mutually agreed upon by the Buyer and/or Seller for the purchase and/or sale of the goods and/or
                    commodities (each, a <strong>“Smart-Contract”</strong> ). Each Smart-Contract will become binding
                    upon Customer and
                    the other parties to the Smart-Contract upon the acceptance and approval of the Smart-Contract by
                    Customer and each party through user-interface of the Service. A Smart-Contract may only be
                    terminated upon the mutual agreement of all parties to the Smart-Contract or as otherwise specified
                    in the terms and conditions of the Smart-Contract.</p>
                <p class=" wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp"><strong>2.2 Transactions. </strong> Customer acknowledges and agrees that once Customer and all other
                    parties to the
                    Smart-Contract accept and approve the Smart-Contract, the Smart Contract will automatically execute
                    each condition, transaction, event, and action, including without limitation, the release and
                    transfer of payment, specified in the Smart-Contract (each, a <strong>“Transaction”</strong> ) in
                    accordance with the
                    terms and conditions of the Smart Contract. <strong>CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
                        THAT
                        Transactions executed in accordance with the Smart-Contract are irreversible REGARDLESS OF ANY
                        TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF THE SMART-CONTRACT AFTER SUCH TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN
                        EXECUTED</strong>.
                    GrainChain cannot and will not be liable under any circumstances for any Transactions made pursuant
                    to a Smart-Contract between Customer and any other user of the Service. GrainChain has no control
                    over, or liability, and Customer is solely responsible, for the delivery, quality, safety, legality
                    or any other aspect of the goods and/or commodities that Customer may purchase or sell using the
                    Services to or from a third party (including other users of the Service). Without limiting the
                    foregoing, to the extent Customer is purchasing goods or other commodities pursuant to a
                    smart-contract entered into in connection with the service, Customer acknowledges and agrees that
                    upon fulfillment of the terms and requirements of a smart-contract entered into between Customer
                    that the funds for such purpose will be automatically and irreversibly transferred from CUSTOMER’S
                    bank account to the seller, and CUSTOMER hereby authorizes such THE PLATFORM TO EXECUTE SUCH
                    TRANSFER OF FUNDS.</p>
                <p class=" wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp"><strong>2.3 Disputes.</strong> Customer understands and agrees that Customer’s and its Authorized
                    Users’ interactions
                    and dealings with other users of the Services, are solely between Customer and such other user.
                    Customer acknowledges and agrees that any problems or disputes between Customer and another user
                    with respect to any interactions, dealings, and/or communications must be resolved solely between
                    Customer and the applicable user. GrainChain is not responsible for any loss, harm or damage of any
                    sort incurred as a result of any such interactions or dealings, and GrainChain has no obligation to
                    become involved in any resulting dispute. CUSTOMER, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS,
                    REPRESENTATIVES, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, CLIENTS, AND ANYONE ELSE CLAIMING BY OR THROUGH CUSTOMER
                    (“customer parties”), HEREBY EXPRESSLY RELEASE, DISCHARGE, AND HOLD GRAINCHAIN AND ITS EMPLOYEES,
                    AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, SHAREHOLDERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AFFILIATES, CONTRACTORS, SUCCESSORS OR
                    ASSIGNEES (THE “RELEASED PARTIES”) HARMLESS FROM, AND WAIVE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS (INCLUDING BUT NOT
                    LIMITED TO CLAIMS FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE, PERSONAL INJURY, OR DEATH), demands, and damages of every
                    kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of
                    or in any way related to such disputes. If customer or any Customer party is a California resident,
                    Customer shall and hereby does waive, on behalf of itself and the customer parties, California Civil
                    Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does
                    not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by
                    him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.</p>

                    GrainChain, through the Services using GrainChain’s third party payment service provider, for the
                    fees due for each Smart-Contract executed through the Service using Customer’s selected payment

                    shall be deemed past due. Payments made under this Agreement after their due date will incur
                    interest at a rate equal to one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the highest rate permitted
                    by applicable law, whichever is lower. In addition, GrainChain reserves the right to immediately
